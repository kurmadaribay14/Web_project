                  <p>Each month I introduce a new author, think of it as an author study. The purpose is so that your child recognizes what an author is and is introduced to new books. </p>
                  <p>TI talk about the author, how they became an author, and basically make him/her a real person in your childs mind so that they realize that they can become an author themselves! Author studies are very important to students of all ages.</p>
